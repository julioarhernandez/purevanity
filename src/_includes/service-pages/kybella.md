  Kybella®   is a non-surgical treatment designed to reduce submental fat, commonly known as a double chin. Unlike invasive surgical procedures, Kybella®   ®   is a minimally invasive option that uses deoxycholic acid, a naturally occurring substance in the body that helps break down fat cells.

<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
    This treatment is perfect for individuals looking for a quick, effective way to enhance their facial profile without undergoing surgery. The results are long-lasting, providing a slimmer, more contoured look in the treated area.

   Comprehensive Overview of Kybella®   
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Kybella®   works by breaking down and absorbing fat cells under the chin. The procedure involves a series of injections directly into the submental area, targeting the fat cells and gradually improving the appearance of the chin and neck. Once the fat cells are destroyed, they cannot store or accumulate fat again, resulting in permanent results.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
    The treatment typically takes 15-20 minutes per session, and most patients see visible results after 2-4 sessions. However, some may need up to 6 sessions depending on their aesthetic goals and the amount of fat in the treatment area.

   Results and How Long They Last
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   After the treatment, you’ll begin to notice a gradual reduction in chin fat within a few weeks. The fat cells targeted by Kybella®   are permanently destroyed, which means results can be long-lasting with proper maintenance.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   However, it's important to maintain a healthy lifestyle as significant weight gain after the treatment can affect the results. Once you reach your goal, further treatments are usually not required.
