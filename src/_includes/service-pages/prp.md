   Comprehensive Overview of Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   PRP therapy involves extracting a small amount of your blood, processing it to concentrate the platelets, and then injecting it back into the treatment area. Platelets contain growth factors that help stimulate cell regeneration, collagen production, and healing, making PRP a versatile treatment for both cosmetic and medical purposes.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   The process takes about 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the area being treated. PRP is often used for facial rejuvenation, hair thinning, acne scars, and even to enhance the results of other cosmetic procedures.

   Are You a Candidate for Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP)?
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Most healthy adults are good candidates for PRP therapy, especially those looking for natural, non-invasive treatments. If you are experiencing early signs of aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, or volume loss, or are dealing with hair thinning, PRP may be an excellent solution.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Additionally, PRP is suitable for individuals looking to improve skin texture, reduce acne scars, or rejuvenate areas that have lost firmness. A consultation with a professional can help determine if PRP is right for you.
</p>

<h3 class="services-details-two__title-2">
   Conditions That May Disqualify You
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   While PRP is a natural and safe treatment, it may not be suitable for everyone. People with certain medical conditions, such as blood disorders, active infections, or cancer, may not be eligible for PRP therapy. Additionally, if you are taking blood-thinning medications or have a history of excessive bleeding, you should consult with a healthcare professional before undergoing PRP.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   It’s important to provide a full medical history to your provider during the consultation to ensure that PRP is the right treatment for you.

   What Issues Can Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Address?
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) therapy is an innovative treatment that uses your body's own healing factors to address various skin and hair concerns. PRP is effective for improving skin texture, reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, promoting hair growth, and enhancing overall skin rejuvenation.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   PRP is especially beneficial for individuals seeking a natural solution to acne scars, sun damage, and hair thinning. It’s also popular for improving skin tone and elasticity, giving the skin a youthful, glowing appearance without the use of synthetic fillers or chemicals.
</p>

<h3 class="services-details-two__title-2">
   What to Expect During a PRP Treatment
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   During a PRP treatment, a small amount of blood is drawn from your arm, which is then processed in a centrifuge to separate the platelets. These concentrated platelets are rich in growth factors that stimulate tissue repair and regeneration. The PRP is then injected or applied to the target area using microneedling or direct injections.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   The entire procedure typically takes about 45 minutes to an hour. While there may be some discomfort during the injections, most patients find the process well-tolerated. A topical numbing cream can also be applied to minimize any discomfort.
