   What Issues Can PDO Threads Address?
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   PDO Thread lifts are a non-surgical facelift solution that can address a variety of aesthetic concerns. These threads can help with sagging skin, loss of volume, and fine lines, particularly around the jawline, neck, cheeks, and brow area. By lifting and tightening the skin, PDO Threads restore a more youthful appearance.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   In addition to lifting, PDO Threads also stimulate collagen production, helping to improve skin texture and firmness over time. This makes it a popular option for those looking for long-lasting improvements in facial contours without undergoing invasive surgery.
</p>

<h3 class="services-details-two__title-2">
  What to Expect During a PDO Thread Treatment
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   PDO Thread treatments typically begin with a consultation to determine your aesthetic goals. The procedure itself is minimally invasive and performed under local anesthesia. Your practitioner will insert the PDO threads under your skin using a thin needle or cannula. The threads are then positioned to lift and tighten the targeted areas.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Most treatments take about 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the number of threads being placed. Patients usually experience minimal discomfort during the procedure, and there is no need for general anesthesia, making it a relatively simple outpatient treatment.

   Recovery and Downtime
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   One of the major advantages of PDO Threads is the minimal downtime. Patients may experience mild swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the treatment area, but these symptoms typically subside within a few days. Most people can resume normal activities within 24-48 hours.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   It’s recommended to avoid strenuous activities, heavy lifting, or facial massages for about a week after the procedure to ensure optimal results. Any visible threads will typically settle into place and become less noticeable after a few days.
