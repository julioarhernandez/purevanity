   Comprehensive Overview of Hand Rejuvenation
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Radiesse® is an FDA-approved dermal filler made from calcium hydroxylapatite (CaHA) microspheres, which are naturally absorbed by the body over time. When injected into the hands, Radiesse® not only adds immediate volume but also encourages your body’s natural collagen production, improving skin texture and firmness that lasts longer than traditional fillers.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   The treatment is quick, typically taking 30 to 45 minutes. Most patients experience minimal discomfort as a local anesthetic is often applied to the treatment area. Since Radiesse® is a biostimulatory filler, its effects continue to improve over the following weeks, with results lasting up to 12 to 18 months.

   What to Expect During a Hand Rejuvenation Treatment
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   A hand rejuvenation treatment typically takes around 30 to 45 minutes. Your provider will start by cleansing the area and possibly applying a topical anesthetic to minimize discomfort. Radiesse® is then injected into targeted areas on the hands to restore volume and smooth skin texture.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   The procedure is minimally invasive, and most patients report feeling only mild pressure during the injections. The provider may gently massage the area to ensure even distribution and a natural look.
