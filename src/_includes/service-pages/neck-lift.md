   Comprehensive Overview of Neck Lift Surgery
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   A neck lift is a surgical procedure that involves removing excess skin and tightening underlying muscles to create a more defined and youthful neck appearance. It may also include liposuction to remove excess fat, further enhancing neck contours. The results can last several years, making it a popular choice for those seeking a more permanent solution to neck and jawline aging.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   The procedure typically takes about two to three hours, depending on the extent of correction needed. Most patients receive local anesthesia with sedation, though general anesthesia may be an option. A neck lift can provide dramatic, lasting results, with a natural rejuvenation that significantly improves facial harmony.

<h3 class="services-details-two__title-2">
   Conditions That May Disqualify You
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   While a neck lift is safe for most individuals, certain conditions may disqualify you. These include underlying health issues that could affect healing, such as uncontrolled diabetes, heart conditions, or blood clotting disorders. Smokers are also advised to quit prior to surgery to minimize complications.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   During your consultation, your provider will review your medical history and evaluate potential risks to ensure a neck lift is a safe option for you.

   What Issues Can a Neck Lift Address?
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">

</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">

<h3 class="services-details-two__title-2">
   What to Expect During a Neck Lift Procedure
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   A neck lift typically takes two to three hours. The provider will begin by marking the area, followed by incisions around the ear or under the chin, depending on the technique used. Through these incisions, excess skin is removed, and underlying muscles are tightened. Liposuction may be included for contouring.
</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Post-procedure, patients can expect mild swelling and bruising for a few days, but most find the results well worth it. Your provider may also recommend post-surgery care to aid recovery.

   Alternatives to a Neck Lift
</h3>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">

</p>
<p class="services-details-two__text-2">
   Consulting with a qualified provider will help you determine if a neck lift or an alternative is best for achieving your aesthetic goals.
